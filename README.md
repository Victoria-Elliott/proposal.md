The hardest part of this project was making it so that the output of the word to guess DID NOT include ANY of the letters that the user already guessed. Additionally, revealing the letters when the user successfully guessed a letter in the word was equally as difficult. What it came down to was making a bunch of functions, and one "big" function that calls those previous functions. That made my code work. This was hands down the hardest project I have ever had to complete for school but it was also rewarding because I was able to challenge myself and see what I am capable of. 

Side note: I deleted, scraped, and edited this code more days than I have been on this earth--at least that's what it feels like.

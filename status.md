Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have programmed a hangman game

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Change the code so that the word is being changed behind the scene making it near impossible for the player to win

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am finding it difficult to change the code so that it is not noticed by the user and the letters guessed by the user are maintained at the proper index.
